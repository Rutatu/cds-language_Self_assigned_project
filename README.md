#Text Classification Using CNN and Pre-trained Glove Word Embeddings: Emotion classification


## About the script


This assignment is a self-assigned project. For this assignment I have chosen to train a Logistic Regression (LR) model and CNN model with pre-trained Glove Word Embeddings for a text classification task
-  classifying tweets based on 4 emotions: joy, sadness, anger and fear. The script trains a Logistic Regression (LR) model on tweets to establish a baseline model performance. Then, it trains a CNN model 
uisng pre-trained Glove Word Embeddings
